# ETL Project - Trending Videos on YouTube by Country

This project tracks the trending videos on YouTube by country.
Depending on the country you live in, YouTube creates an algorithm specific to that country showing the trending videos that day.
Much of our data was extracted from three different nations from around June of 2017 to March of 2018, though the starting and ending dates for each nation often varied, which prevented analyzing trending videos on specific days.
We utilized the Extract, Transform, and Load, or ETL method to create datasets and MySQL databases to store data from three different nations.
